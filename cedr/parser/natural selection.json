Owing to the abundant\nfree energy in our universe, there is a struggle for supremacy that naturally\nrewards those that are first to invent novelties that allow exploitation of\nuntapped resources. This natural reward comes in form of a temporary monopoly,\nwhich is granted to those who win a competitive race to innovate. By analogy to\nhuman economies, natural selection plays the role of nature's inventor,\ngradually fashioning inventions to the situation at hand, while natural reward\nplays the role of nature's entrepreneur, choosing which inventions to first\ndisseminate to large markets. Natural reward leads to progress through a\nprocess of invention-conquest macroevolution, in which the dual forces of\nnatural selection and natural reward create and disseminate major innovations.\nOver vast time frames, natural reward drives the advancement of life by a\nprocess of extinction-replacement megaevolution that releases constraints on\nprogress and increases the innovativeness of life.\n"],"author":[{"name":["Owen M.

This apparently self-evident proposition, however, is\nderived under the assumption that genetic variation within a population is\nprimarily supplied by mutation (i.e.\\ mutation-driven evolution).

By numerically investigating population\ngenetics models of recombination, migration and selection, we demonstrate that\nstronger selection can slow down evolution on a perfectly smooth fitness\nlandscape.

However, population dynamics inherently generate\nnoise in numbers of individuals and selection acts on various components of the\nindividuals' fitness. In plant species with seed banks, the size of both the\nabove- and below-ground compartments present noise depending on seed production\nand the state of the seed bank. We investigate if this noise has consequences\non 1)~the rate of genetic drift, and 2)~the efficacy of selection. We consider\nfour variants of two-allele Moran-type models defined by combinations of\npresence and absence of noise in above-ground and seed bank compartments. Time\nscale analysis and dimension reduction methods allow us to reduce the\ncorresponding Fokker-Planck equation to a one-dimensional diffusion\napproximation of a Moran model. We first show that if the above-ground noise\nclassically affects the rate of genetic drift, below-ground noise reduces the\ndiversity storage effect of the seed bank. Second, we consider that selection\ncan act on four different components of the plant fitness: plant or seed death\nrate, seed production or seed germination. Our striking result is that the\nefficacy of selection for seed death rate or germination rate is reduced by\nseed bank noise, whereas selection occurring on plant death rate or seed\nproduction is not affected.

Many more genetic variants may violate these exclusion\nrestrictions due to unknown pleiotropic effects (i.e. direct effects on the\noutcome not via the exposure), but their inclusion could increase the precision\nof causal effect estimates at the cost of allowing some bias.

Traditionally, many of the selection-based processes used to\ndescribe cultural and genetic evolution (such as imitation and birth-death\nmodels) have been studied on a case-by-case basis. Over time, these models have\ngrown in sophistication to include population structure, differing phenotypes,\nand various forms of interaction asymmetry, among other features. Furthermore,\nmany processes inspired by natural selection, such as evolutionary algorithms\nin computer science, possess characteristics that should fall within the realm\nof a \"selection process,\" but so far there is no overarching theory\nencompassing these evolutionary processes. The framework of $\\textit{stochastic\nselection processes}$ we present here provides such a theory and consists of\nthree main components: a $\\textit{population state space}$, an\n$\\textit{aggregate payoff function}$, and an $\\textit{update rule}$. A\npopulation state space is a generalization of the notion of population\nstructure, and it can include non-spatial information such as strategy-mutation\nrates and phenotypes. An aggregate payoff function allows one to generically\ntalk about the fitness of traits without explicitly specifying a method of\npayoff accounting or even the nature of the interactions that determine\npayoff/fitness. An update rule is a fitness-based function that updates a\npopulation based on its current state, and it includes as special cases the\nclassical update mechanisms (Moran, Wright-Fisher, etc.) as well as more\ncomplicated mechanisms involving chromosomal crossover, mutation, and even\ncomplex cultural syntheses of strategies of neighboring individuals.

Here, we analyze how motion of individuals affects constant\nselection in structured populations. Motion is relevant because it leads to\nchanges in the distribution of types as mutations march toward fixation or\nextinction. We describe motion as the swapping of individuals on graphs, and\nmore generally as the shuffling of individuals between reproductive updates.\nBeginning with a one-dimensional graph, the cycle, we prove that motion\nsuppresses natural selection for death-birth updating or for any process that\ncombines birth-death and death-birth updating. If the rule is purely\nbirth-death updating, no change in fixation probability appears in the presence\nof motion. We further investigate how motion affects evolution on the square\nlattice and weighted graphs. In the case of weighted graphs we find that motion\ncan be either an amplifier or a suppressor of natural selection. In some cases,\nwhether it is one or the other can be a function of the relative reproductive\nrate, indicating that motion is a subtle and complex attribute of evolving\npopulations. As a first step towards understanding less restricted types of\nmotion in evolutionary graph theory, we consider a similar rule on dynamic\ngraphs induced by a spatial flow and find qualitatively similar results\nindicating that continuous motion also suppresses natural selection.\n"],"author":[{"name":["Madison S.
