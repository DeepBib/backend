Natural language processing (NLP) has emerged as a promising\ndirection for taming information overload. In particular, large neural language\nmodels facilitate transfer learning by pretraining on unlabeled text, as\nexemplified by the successes of BERT models in various NLP applications.\nHowever, fine-tuning such models for an end task remains challenging,\nespecially with small labeled datasets, which are common in biomedical NLP.\n  Results: We conduct a systematic study on fine-tuning stability in biomedical\nNLP. We show that finetuning performance may be sensitive to pretraining\nsettings, especially in low-resource domains. Large models have potential to\nattain better performance, but increasing model size also exacerbates\nfinetuning instability. We thus conduct a comprehensive exploration of\ntechniques for addressing fine-tuning instability. We show that these\ntechniques can substantially improve fine-tuning performance for lowresource\nbiomedical NLP applications. Specifically, freezing lower layers is helpful for\nstandard BERT-BASE models, while layerwise decay is more effective for\nBERT-LARGE and ELECTRA models. For low-resource text similarity tasks such as\nBIOSSES, reinitializing the top layer is the optimal strategy. Overall,\ndomainspecific vocabulary and pretraining facilitate more robust models for\nfine-tuning.
